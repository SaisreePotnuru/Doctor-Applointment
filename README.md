Doctor Appointment will help doctors and patients to save their time.
The main cause for this project is that when we go to hospital for check-up we have to wait for hours.
Instead with this app we can easily go to the hospital at assigned time.
However we didn't implemented all the requirements.
We only did till approve and deny the appointment.

Developed fully responsible web application.
