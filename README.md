Title: Doctor Appointment

Doctor Appointment will help doctors and patients to save their time. The main cause for this project is that when we go to hospital for check-up we have to wait for hours. Instead with this app we can easily go to the hospital at assigned time. Each and every person should register to use the service. Once registered they can login with previous details and do the needed operations. User can login and submit the appointment request and can view the status. Whereas doctor can login and check the appointments and based on his/her interest they can approve/deny the requests which will reflect the status in patient portal. However we didn't implemented all the requirements. We only did till approve and deny the appointment.
